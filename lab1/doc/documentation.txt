Welcome to PA1, by Nikita Usenko! This is a simple HTTP GET/HEAD client that
takes a hostname and URL (possibly with specified port), and returns the HTTP
request that the server sends back. The basic bare minimum usage is as follows:

./pa1 (hostname) (URL) <-h (optional)>

The program will return the HTTP GET response into the file "output.dat".
The hostname is the hostname of the server, such as "example.com".
The URL includes the IP address, optionally a specified port (if none provided,
the default used will be 80, HTTP port).
The -h flag is used to signify the HTTP HEAD request rather than GET. When this
is used, the program will output the HEAD response to stdout rather than
"output.dat".

The makefile has a few options as well.

"make" or "make pa1" will build pa1.
The option "cleanpa1" will remove pa1 and output.dat
The options "testPa1(G/H)<P>" run some basic tests on the program with options
on GET/HEAD and optional ports. This is mostly used for for my automated CI
pipeline tests, and probably not going to be used by you.

Some internal design notes about how the program operates.
1. The program first checks the arguments passed to it, and copies them down. It
also checks for the optional "-h" flag at the end and marks an int if it is
provided.
2. The program then splits the provided argument strings into tokens for future
use. This includes the host, ipaddress, port (if present), and file path. It
saves them to memory for future operations.
3. The program then builds the needed message to send to the server. It actually
builds two messages, one for the GET and one for the HEAD. This is possibly a
drawback to the program as it never uses both at once. It is a bit wasteful but
it works so unless the url or hostname are insanely long, it shouldn't cause any
issue.
4. The socket is then created, information for ipaddress and port passed, and
the socket connected.
5. The program then selects which message to send (GET or HEAD), and sends it.
6. The program then selects output depending on the "-h" flag (file or stdout),
and reads into a buffer and then writes to the output. This allows for virtually
unlimited size of the reply.
7. The program then closes the socket, file (if needed), and frees memory.
